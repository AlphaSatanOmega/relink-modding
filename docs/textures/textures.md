# :material-texture: UI Textures

Most UI (& other) textures are contained within `.wtb` files - a carry-over from Platinum Games's texture format.

To convert them to standard image formats and converting back, grab [Nier CLI](https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/nier_cli/releases/tag/v1.3.0_mgrr).

* To extract textures, simply drop any `.wtb` file into the executable. A folder will be created.
* To convert them back, drag the extracted folder into the tool's executable. **This will overwrite the `.wtb` file.**
