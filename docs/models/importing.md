# :material-application-import: Model Importing

!!! note

    Importing requires Blender knowledge.

## Blender Plugin

[GBFRBlenderImporter](https://github.com/WistfulHopes/GBFRBlenderImporter/releases) is required for model imports. Download the latest release of the ***Importer***, not the ***Exporter***.

In Blender:

* In Edit :material-arrow-right: Preferences :material-arrow-right: Add-ons
* Click `Install`
* Select the zip file you just downloaded
* Make sure to tick `Granblue Fantasy Relink Mesh Importer`.

## Importing

!!! tip

    * Ensure that `.minfo`, `.mmesh` and `.skeleton` files are all in the same folder. You may need to copy the `.mmesh` over. Refer to [Asset Paths](../resources/asset_paths.md) for their location.
    * Model heads/faces are split into their own files.

In Blender:

* In File :material-arrow-right: Import :material-arrow-right: Granblue Fantasy Relink .minfo
* Select a .minfo file.
